# Blockchain-powered-social-media
Developed a decentralized social media platform using React.js, Solidity, JavaScript, Web3.js, and Bootstrap. Utilized Ganache to host a local blockchain and Pinata IPFS for image storage. This project highlights my ability to integrate blockchain technology with modern web development tools.
